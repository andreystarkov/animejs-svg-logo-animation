# Anime.js SVG Logo Animation Demo

My good old friend asked me for help: to put this logo on his website.
So i didn't missed the chance to create fresh simple animation demo. 
It uses hottest version of [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) (3.x)
This lib keeps killing it. Just [check its new docs](https://animejs.com/documentation/).

## Its so easy
